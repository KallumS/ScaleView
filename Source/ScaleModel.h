/*
    ScaleModel - the musical core of ScaleView, with no dependency on JUCE or
    on any host, so it can be unit tested on its own.

    Note names are spelled for the key that is selected rather than always
    being sharps or flats: each degree of a seven-note scale takes the next
    letter of the alphabet and whatever accidental that letter then needs.
    C# major reads C# D# E# F# G# A# B#, while Db major - the same seven
    notes - reads Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C.
